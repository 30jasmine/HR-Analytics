Welcome to the **HR Analytics Project** for Atliq Technologies! This project focuses on analyzing employee attendance data from the past three months to help the HR Generalist gain meaningful insights. Using **Power BI Desktop**, we processed and visualized the data to uncover trends in attendance, work modes (Work From Home vs. Work From Office), and sick leave patterns.  

---

## **Project Overview**  

Atliq Technologies' HR team wanted a deeper understanding of employee attendance habits. The goal was to analyze attendance data to identify trends, improve retention strategies, and explore the factors contributing to sick leaves. Additionally, the project aimed to differentiate between **Work From Home (WFH)** and **Work From Office (WFO)** attendance percentages.  

---

## **Data Source & Preparation**  

- The attendance data was provided as an **Excel file**.  
- We used **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques** to clean and format the data for analysis.  
- Key metrics were created using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** in Power BI to calculate attendance rates, sick leave percentages, and WFH/WFO distributions.

## **Approach & Methodology**  

### **1. Understanding the Problem**  
- Defined key focus areas: **attendance trends, retention strategies, and sick leave patterns**.  

### **2. Data Collection & Transformation**  
- Imported the attendance data from an **Excel file**.  
- Applied **ETL operations** to clean and structure the data for analysis.  

### **3. Creating Key Metrics with DAX**  
- Developed calculated metrics, such as:  
  - **Attendance percentages**  
  - **Sick leave rates**  
  - **Work From Home vs. Work From Office distributions**  

### **4. Building the Dashboard in Power BI**  
- Designed **interactive visualizations** to highlight attendance patterns.  
- Used Power BIâ€™s filtering and slicing features to allow for deep data exploration.
